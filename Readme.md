### ferr_os : a simple rust kernel 
---
##### Motivation
After taking multiple courses on Operating Systems, I've come to really enjoy systems-level programming. I especially enjoyed getting the opportunity to learn about and create my own kernel from scratch in C this past year in UBC's CPSC 415. Some might find my obsession with kernels strange, but I think it's so cool to interface with computer systems at this level. 

Building off of my excitement, I've decided to make this kernel so that:
- I can retain my knowledge from CPSC 415
- I can learn/implement new concepts on my own
- I get practice with Rust, a really neat language

This tutorial [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/) really got me off the ground with creating the binary. I'm hoping to do the rest from that point onwards by myself though!
